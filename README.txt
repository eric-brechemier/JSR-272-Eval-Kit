  This project shall provide means of evaluating the Usability of JSR 272 API, 
  by featuring a collection of tests and use cases.
  
  JSR 272 API, or Mobile Broadcast Service API for Handheld Terminals, is a 
  standard effort lead by Nokia and Motorola to define a middleware-level API 
  enabling the development of Mobile TV applications on J2ME. The JSR 272 initiative 
  is part of Sun Java Community Process.
  
  While I followed parts of the development of this specification as a member of the 
  expert group, I am no longer part of it since I left Expway, and this project is not
  affiliated nor endorsed by the JSR 272 group. I am aware that JSR 272 is subject to
  Motorola and Nokia copyright, and I do not intend to develop a claimed implementation
  of the specification as part of this project.
  
  This project will only make use of documentation/software available for public 
  download from the JSR 272 homepage [http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=272], starting 
  with latest public version, Proposed Final Draft 2 published on	13 Jul, 2007.
  
  The project deliverables will be:
  - test sets in XML and Java (J2ME) based on JUnit/J2MEUnit
  - Java (J2ME) midlets demonstrating JSR-272 usage
  - Ant build scripts
  - optionally, documentation collecting public comments on JSR-272
  - optionally, a low-level API to facilitate JSR-272 implementation
